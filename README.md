## Feel the power of Interpreter as Portable Interpreter

Share your Python Environment directly, Let Everyone enjoy coding ,No more Installation needed, Just fire to Rock

A standalone Python Executable to Run your Python scripts so that You can distribute Python code directly .It simply uses Python exec() to run your code.


As a servant of Science my responsibility is to make Python Modules available as magic executable so you don't have worry about installation of modules and setting things

You just write Python code or may be black box and share it open.

It automatically put your Python file location in its Environment so the package and other modules if used is simply recognised to work
